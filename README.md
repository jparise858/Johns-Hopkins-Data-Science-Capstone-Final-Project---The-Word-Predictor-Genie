Johns Hopkins Data Science Capstone Final Project - The Word Predictor Genie

To run the Word Genie application, load the server and ui files and remember to load the ngram.rds files into your working directory. Alternatively if you want to test the creation of the rds files, you can run first the RMD file which creates the rds files. 

Thank you!
